# PostureApp
**Posture Mate** is a friendly iOS app that helps users maintain proper posture while using their phones. Acting like a wellness companion, it detects when the phone is being used in an unhealthy position and gently reminds the user to correct it.

## 🧠 Concept

Most people spend hours on their phones, often with their necks bent down, leading to long-term health issues. Posture Mate works in the background to:

- Detect incorrect usage angles
- Send customizable reminders
- Provide analytics on phone posture habits
- Offer tips and medical-based recommendations
